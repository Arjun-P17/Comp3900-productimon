# Privacy Policy

By using our hosted [my.productimon.com](https://my.productimon.com) instance, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information for the purposes of providing you our product services as described below.

## Your data is never shared

Your privacy is really important to us. At Productimon, your data, analyzed, is the product we offer back to you. We are not ad-supported. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please contact us. Below are the details of this policy:

1. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information, with or without personally identifying information. Furthermore, we will never share anonymized selections of your individual data. That includes any government (foreign or domestic) unless we are compelled by law. If we are required by law to disclose any of the information collected about you, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure. We will attempt to provide this notice by email. We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of our site.
2. We may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could share information like, "which day of the week do people spend the most time in front of their computer?" This type of analysis is used to enrich the product, and to represent our domain expertise to our audiences.
   You can delete your data at any time â€” all of it. You can also delete your account at any time. Deleting your account deletes all your data from our database.
3. We won't spam you, ever, either directly or indirectly by sharing email information. We might occasionally send one-time messages about important Productimon news. We will likely continue to introduce ways that you can optionally have Productimon contact you with data that you care about, but you will always be able to turn this on or off.
4. No other user can see any of your data or personal information. We may provide features to allow you to share selections of your data, but this will be voluntary and opt-in only, and handled per-situation, and not buried in terms of service.

## How do we protect your data?

Your data is always encrypted in transit. All requests with DataReporter is encrypted with certificate-based mTLS, with DataViewer using https + auth token.

## What information does Productimon collect? How is it used?

Account information includes email and hashed password.

Productimon records information about the currently active application or website on your computer. We record for processing the following information: 1) for time analysis: application name, website URL, window title, start time of use, end time of use, number of keystrokes and mouse clicks (just number, not content) and 2) for distinguishing you and your device: a device name of your choice and operating system version.

We do not (and never will) collect keystroke content (we only collect statistics), form input, screenshots, window or page body content, or anything nefarious. Before storage for your reports, URLs are trimmed to the site name and sometimes top level directory when a site has distinct web apps. Query strings are discarded.

## Auth token and certificate

Productimon signs an auth token and a certificate that is unique to you. We use this to validate your authentication, provide you with a continuous experience. It is not used for marketing purposes.

## Disclaimer

While we protect your data and privacy, we don't guarantee that my.productimon.com will always be up and your data won't be lost. It is recommended that you host your own server.
